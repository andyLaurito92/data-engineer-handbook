## Dimensional modelling

### Aditive dimensions
Additive dimensions --> Those that can be decomposed in subgroups which do not intersect. 
Example: Age -> Group of people who have 10, who have 20, who have 30 ... etc. The sum of these groups is the total
Example of a NOT additive dimension -> Number of users in my app by device! #users of apple + #users of android != number of users of my app
Bc there might be a user who uses both android and apple!

### Enums

Use enums for small number of values (<50). They are good for subpartition!! (Partition by date > enum value)
Also add data quality

See the little book of enums pipelines

## Graph databases

Focus on relationships, how things are connected, rather than the entities --> meaning, the edges!
